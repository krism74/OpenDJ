<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p> OpenDS is an open source community project building a free and comprehensive next generation directory service. OpenDS is designed to address large deployments, to provide high performance, to be highly extensible, and to be easy to deploy, manage and monitor. The directory service includes not only the Directory Server, but also other essential directory-related services like directory proxy, virtual directory, namespace distribution and data synchronization. Initial development of OpenDS was done by Sun Microsystems, but is now available under the open source Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL). </p>
<p>For more detailed information on the project see the <a href="docs/OpenDS-FAQ.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a> page.</p>
<p>The OpenDS project  is currently staffed with some of the most experienced engineers and directory server experts that Sun has to offer, but we are in the early stages of this endeavor and are looking for community contribution on the project to make it hands down the best directory server out there. Have a look at who's working on the project on the <a href="misc/bios.html">OpenDS Project Who's Who</a> page. 
<p>If you are ready to get involved, find out how on our <a href="community_index.html">Community Page</a>. 
<h3>Project Governance and Licensing</h3>
<p>The OpenDS code is released under the Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL). Information about this license can be found at <a href="../OpenDS.LICENSE">https://opends.dev.java.net/OpenDS.LICENSE</a> and at <a href="http://www.sun.com/cddl/">http://www.sun.com/cddl/</a>.</p>
<p>The OpenDS project follows a simple governance structure:
</p>
<ul>
      <li>Decisions are made in public discussion groups.</li>
      <li>Decisions are made by consensus, rather than voting.</li>
      <li>Decisions are made transparently and any member of the project can voice their
          concerns.</li>
</ul>
    <p>
    Everyone is welcome to join the OpenDS community and make contributions.  OpenDS members follow
    the code of conduct and abide by the governance process.  OpenDS members can participate in one
    or more of the following roles:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Observer</li>
      <li>Contributor</li>
      <li>Committer</li>
      <li>Project Owner</li>
      <li>Project Manager</li>
</ul>
    <p>
