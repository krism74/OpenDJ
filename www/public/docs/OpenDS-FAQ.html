    <a name="what_is_opends">
    <b>What is the OpenDS Directory Server?</b>
    <br>
    The OpenDS Directory Server is a pure Java implementation of a network-accessible database that
    is able to store information in a hierarchical form.  Clients may communicate with it using a
    standard protocol like LDAP or DSML in order to retrieve and update information in a variety of
    ways.  Other examples of directory servers include:
    <ul>
      <li>Sun Java System Directory Server</li>
      <li>Novell eDirectory</li>
      <li>Oracle Internet Directory</li>
      <li>CA eTrust Directory Server</li>
      <li>Microsoft Active Directory</li>
      <li>The OpenLDAP Project</li>
      <li>The Apache Directory Project</li>
    </ul>
    Initial development on the OpenDS Directory Server was conducted by Sun Microsystems, but it
    has been made available under the open source Common Development and Distribution License
    (CDDL), and all future development will be conducted under this license.

    <br><br><br>

    <a name="goals">
    <b>What are the primary goals of the OpenDS Directory Server?</b>
    <br>
    The primary goals for the OpenDS Directory Server include:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Performance</b> -- It must be extremely fast, outperforming all other servers on the
          market wherever possible.</li>
      <li><b>Upward Vertical Scalability</b> -- It must be capable of handling billions of entries
          in a single instance on appropriately-sized hardware.  It should be able to make
          efficient use at least hundreds of gigabytes of memory, and it should be able to make
          effective use of at least 32 CPU cores.</li>
      <li><b>Downward Vertical Scalability</b> -- It must be capable of running adequately in
          low-memory environments so that all essential components may be functional with a Java
          heap of no more than 16 megabytes.</li>
      <li><b>Horizontal Scalability</b> -- It must be possible to use synchronization to achieve
          horizontal read scalability.  It must be possible to use data distribution in conjunction
          with synchronization to achieve horizontal read and write scalability.</li>
      <li><b>Supportability</b> -- The server should work properly and in an intuitive manner
          wherever possible.  If a problem does arise, the server must be able to provide
          sufficient information to determine the cause of the problem so that it can be corrected
          as quickly as possible.  All messages that may be written to the error log or included in
          a response to the client must be given unique integer IDs.  The server must be able to
          integrate with common monitoring frameworks, and must be able to generate alert
          notifications in the event that a significant problem is detected.</li>
      <li><b>Security</b> -- The server must provide unmatched security in areas like access
          control, encryption, authentication, auditing, and password and account management.</li>
      <li><b>Extensibility</b> -- Virtually every aspect of the server should be customizable.  It
          will have a safe and simple plugin API (with more plugin points than the current Sun Java
          System Directory Server), but will also have additional points of extensibility,
          including password validation algorithms, password generators, monitor information
          providers, logging subsystems, backend repositories, protocol handlers, administrative
          tasks, SASL mechanisms, extended operations, attribute syntaxes, and matching rules.</li>
      <li><b>Synchronization</b> -- The server must support data synchronization between instances,
          including not only total data synchronization but also partial synchronization (with
          fractional, filtered, and subtree capabilities), and must also provide a means of
          synchronizing with other applications.</li>
      <li><b>Availability</b> -- The server must be robust so that it can continue running properly
          even in the case of all but the most severe errors.  Virtually all configuration changes
          should be able to take effect without restarting or significantly impacting availability.
          The server should have a mechanism for attempting to notify proxy servers and/or load
          balancers if a change will be made to its availability so that future requests can be
          routed away from that server if possible.</li>
      <li><b>Portability</b> -- The server must be written entirely in Java so that it may run on
          any platform with a Java SE 5.0 or higher runtime environment.  Any administrative and/or
          wrapper scripts needed to invoke the Java code should be written as portable Bourne shell
          scripts for all UNIX (and UNIX-like) platforms, and batch files for Windows systems.
          Platform-specific elements must be kept to a minimum.</li>
      <li><b>Migratability</b> -- Even though the Sun Java System Directory Server will continue to
          be maintained for some period of time and will not be immediately supplanted by the
          OpenDS Directory Server, the OpenDS server must provide support for virtually all
          existing features of the Sun Java System Directory Server.  Any functionality that is not
          carried forward should be explicitly identified and justification must be provided to
          indicate why it has been deprecated.  Note that this requirement does not mandate that
          the feature is implemented in the same way or using the same syntax if there is a
          significant advantage in varying from the current implementation, although the migration
          path should always be a consideration.  Migration from other directory server
          implementations should also be taken into consideration when applicable.  Automating the
          migration process in these cases is a lower priority, but features in other products that
          could make migration difficult should be identified and addressed.</li>
    </ul>

    <br><br><br>

    <a name="state">
    <b>What is the current state of the OpenDS Directory Server?</b>
    <br>
    The OpenDS Directory Server is very much a work in progress.  We have decided to pursue an open
    development process so that everyone can see and comment on the work that is being done, and
    contribute to it wherever applicable.  However, we also felt that we needed a
    minimally-functional codebase before entering the open source community so that other people
    interested in the project can have something immediately available for experimentation and to
    get an understanding of the basic framework.  As such, the code that is currently available
    provides support fro the following components:
    <ul>
      <li>Basic support for all core LDAPv3 operations, including abandon, add, bind, compare,
          delete, extended operations, modify, modify DN, search, and unbind operations.</li>
      <li>Basic support for a number of controls, including proxied authorization, persistent
          search, LDAP pre-read and post-read, LDAP assertions, matched values, paged results,
          authorization identity request, password policy, and account usability controls.</li>
      <li>Basic support for several SASL mechanisms, including ANONYMOUS, CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5,
          EXTERNAL, GSSAPI, and PLAIN.  There is also an API for adding support for new SASL
          mechanisms.</li>
      <li>Support for a number of extended operations, including "Who am I?", StartTLS, cancel, and
          password modify operations.  There is also an API for adding support for new extended
          operations.</li>
      <li>A number of APIs that allow for the addition of components into the server, including
          plugins, password storage schemes, password validators, password generators, monitor
          providers, logging subsystems, attribute syntaxes, matching rules, and many more.</li>
      <li>Support for backup and restore for server backends, as well as for LDIF import and export
          capabilities.</li>
    </ul>
    There are, however, a number of things that are not yet complete.  This includes:
    <ul>
      <li>No access control model is currently in place in the server.  Until the access control
          subsystem is added, all operations will be allowed for all users.</li>
      <li>There are no CLI or GUI mechanisms for managing the server configuration (although there
          are some command-line tools for performing administrative tasks, and the configuration
          file can be directly edited, or modified through either LDAP or JMX).</li>
      <li>Only a minimal amount of data synchronization functionality is available.</li>
      <li>The password policy functionality is only partially implemented.</li>
      <li>The server does not currently support online schema updates.</li>
      <li>The current logging implementation exhibits poor performance and does not have
          sufficient flexibility.</li>
      <li>The server lacks support for a number of controls and extended operations that are
          expected to be implemented in the future.</li>
      <li>There is no mechanism for dealing with virtual attributes.</li>
    </ul>

    Note that neither of these lists is all-inclusive, and their contents are subject to change as
    development progresses.  The
    <a href="https://OpenDS.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues">issue tracking system</a> is the
    best way to identify the current state of the server and what is planned.

    <a name="future_of_sjsds">
    <b>What is the future of the Sun Java System Directory Server?</b>
    <br>
    The Sun Java System Directory Server is still under active development.  The 6.0 version will
    be released in the near future, and work has already started on the 6.1 release after that.  It
    has not yet been decided whether the OpenDS codebase will completely supplant the current code
    for future versions beyond that.  The OpenDS Directory Server is being developed for production
    use in high-performance and high-volume environments, but it is expected to provide features to
    meet the wide range of customers using the current Sun Java System Directory Server.

    <br><br><br>

    <a name="why_os">
    <b>Why release the OpenDS Directory Server as open source?</b>
    <br>
    Sun believes very strongly in the value of open source and open development, and has
    contributed more software to the open source community than any other organization.  Open
    source provides a number of benefits, both to Sun and the community:
    <ul>
      <li>It helps drive interest in the product and make it more appealing to organizations that
          prefer open source solutions.</li>
      <li>It allows customers to more easily communicate what features they would like to see in
          the product, and even gives them the opportunity to participate in their design and
          implementation if they so desire.</li>
      <li>It gives customers access to the source code so that they can more easily debug problems
          and understand the operation of the server.</li>
      <li>It helps make it easier for OEM partners and other interested parties to create
          customized versions of the product that are optimized for a particular use.</li>
    </ul>

    <br><br><br>

    <a name="why_not_os_sjsds">
    <b>Why not open source the current Sun Java System Directory Server?</b>
    <br>
    The current Sun Java System Directory Server has a distinguished heritage and a proven track
    record.  However, the initial development and release of the codebase was over ten years ago,
    and the performance, scalability, and feature set requirements were very different at that time
    than they are today.  Maintaining this codebase can be challenging, and making a change in one
    area can require an in-depth understanding of a number of different components.  Starting from
    scratch allows us to design for current and future needs, while allowing us to draw on many
    years of experience supporting all manner of customer needs.  We can devise a much more
    readable and compartmentalized codebase that will be more maintainable for the future and
    provides a much lower barrier to entry for developers.
    <br><br>
    It is also worth noting that the current Sun Java System Directory Server shares a common
    ancestor with the Netscape Directory Server, which was purchased by Red Hat and released under
    an open source license by Red Hat.  We have not seen any significant interest in that project,
    and even though there are a number of fixes and enhancements in the current Sun Java System
    Directory Server that are not available from the Red Hat / Fedora Directory Server, we do not
    believe that the benefits of releasing that code base would justify the effort that it would
    require.

    <br><br><br>

    <a name="why_not_contribute">
    <b>Why not contribute to an existing open source project?</b>
    <br>
    There are already a few open source directory servers available, most notably the OpenLDAP,
    Fedora Directory Server, and Apache Directory projects.  However, we feel that creating a new
    project is a better option for us, our customers, and the community at large.  The primary
    reasons for this include:
    <ul>
      <li>Starting from scratch allows us to create a server from the ground up that can be best
          suited to meet the needs of our customers, both now and in the future.  The goals of the
          existing projects do not necessarily line up with the needs of our customers and
          partners, and we would not want to face the danger of forking the code or not being able
          to meet the needs of our customers should they diverge from the goals of the established
          projects.</li>
      <li>It would take a significant effort for us to learn a third-party codebase and update it
          to merely match the feature set, performance, and scalability of our existing product,
          much less to make new improvements and innovations.</li>
      <li>The licenses used by existing open source projects contain terms that are not acceptable
          for our needs.</li>
    </ul>

    <br><br><br>

    <a name="why_cddl">
    <b>Why use CDDL instead of some other license?</b>
    <br>
    The Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL) is an OSI-approved open source license
    that is based on the Mozilla Public License (MPL), but adds additional benefits like extending
    the use of any covered patents to those using the code, and offering some degree of protection
    against patent litigation.  Further, the CDDL is a file-based license, which ensures that any
    code released under the CDDL will remain open, but it does allow it to interact with code under
    other licenses (even closed source licenses).  It will be possible for vendors to create
    components that work with the OpenDS Directory Server under other licenses if they so desire.
    <br><br>
    The OpenLDAP Project and the Red Hat Fedora Directory Server are both available under the GNU
    Public License (GPL), but we did not feel that it was appropriate for use with OpenDS because
    it lacks the patent protection benefits that the CDDL provides, and it does not interact well
    with code under any other license.  Recent proposals for the GPLv3 do appear as if they might
    address these concerns, and if the released version is acceptable then we may consider
    dual-licensing the code under both CDDL and GPLv3.
    <br><br>
    The Apache Directory Project is available under the Apache Public License (APL), but we did not
    feel that it was appropriate for use with OpenDS because it does not ensure that the code will
    remain freely available.  The Apache Public License is much like the BSD license in that it
    would allow anyone to create proprietary modifications of the code that are not given back to
    the community.  We want this code to remain free, and the CDDL ensures that will happen.

    <br><br><br>

    <a name="prebuilt">
    <b>How can I get pre-built versions of the OpenDS Directory Server?</b>
    <br>
    Pre-built versions of the OpenDS Directory Server are available for download under the
    "builds" folder at
    <a href="https://OpenDS.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList">https://OpenDS.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList</a>.
    These builds will generally be updated on a weekly basis.  We also intend to provide a
    publicly-accessible daily build or continuous build system at some point in the near future,
    which may help ensure that code changes can be made available in pre-built form more quickly.

    <a name="configuring">
    <b>How do I configure the OpenDS Directory Server?</b>
    <br>
    The configuration provided with the OpenDS Directory Server may be sufficient for initial
    testing, but there are a number of configurable options.  Some of the most basic options
    (including the TCP port on which to listen, the base DN for the server, and the root user DN
    and password) can be configured using a tool that is documented in the OpenDS Install Guide
    (available in either <a href="OpenDS-Install-Guide.odt">OpenDocument</a> or
    <a href="OpenDS-Install-Guide.pdf">PDF</a> format).  A more comprehensive reference for
    interacting with the OpenDS configuration may be found in the OpenDS Configuration Guide (also

    <a name="why_java">
    <b>Why use Java instead of some other language like C or C++?</b>
    <br>
    Java is a very portable language that allows for quick development of robust applications that
    work without recompilation on a wide variety of platforms (including those that we have been
    unable to support in the past).  It has special support for networking and concurrent
    processing, which has been particularly improved in recent versions.  Its exception handling
    capabilities make it possible to devise very stable and failure-resistant applications, and it
    can provide a wealth of debugging information when a problem does occur so that its cause can
    be quickly identified.
    <br><br>
    It is also worth noting that despite a reputation to the contrary, Java offers excellent
    performance.  Java bytecode is natively compiled at runtime, which benefits from inspecting the
    running code and can result in performance that exceeds that of C and C++ applications.
    Further, there are a number of profiling and other performance analysis tools for Java that can
    help identify potential hotspots and areas of contention.  Finally, Java applications can also
    benefit from performance improvements in the JVM, which is an area that is frequently being
    improved.  In many ways, the performance of the OpenDS Directory Server already exceeds that of
    the Sun Java System Directory Server, which is widely regarded as the fastest server on the
    market.
