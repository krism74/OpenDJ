    <b>General debugging tips</b>
    <br>
    For most problems, the best place to look for help in finding the
    underlying cause is in the server log files.  In most cases, the error log
    will contain any available information serious warnings and errors,
    although some of this information (particularly during server startup) may
    go into the server.out file on startup when running on UNIX-based systems.
    For failures during operation processing, the access log may be the best
    place to look.
    <br><br>
    If the problem is reproducible, then running the server in debug mode may
    also be useful.  Most of the debug functionality of the OpenDS Directory
    Server is tied into the assertions framework so that it will be completely
    ignored (and therefore have no performance impact whatsoever) if assertions
    are disabled.  To enable assertions, pass the "-ea" argument to the JVM
    when the server is started (by setting the <code>JAVA_ARGS</code>
    environment variable to have the value "-ea").  Note that enabling
    assertions can have a significant impact on performance because of the
    significantly greater amount of work that the server must do.

    <br><br><br>

    <a name="wont_start"></a>
    <b>The server won't start</b>
    <br>
    The most common reasons for the server not starting include:
    <ul>
      <li>The startup script or batch file cannot find the Java environment to
          use to run the server.</li>
      <li>That instance of the server is already running.</li>
      <li>There is a problem with the configuration.</li>
      <li>The JVM has been passed an argument that is either illegal or is out
          of range (e.g., the JVM couldn't allocate the specified amount of
          memory).</li>
      <li>An invalid command-line argument was provided to the server.</li>
    </ul>

    On UNIX systems, starting the server with "-nodetach" as the first
    argument will cause the server to run in the foreground rather than as a
    background process, and it may be easier to see any applicable error
    message (at present, the server will always run in this mode on Windows
    systems).  If the server doesn't provide any useful information about the
    problem by default in either the error log or the server.out file, then
    enabling assertions in the JVM will likely help.
    <br><br>
    If an adequate Java environment cannot be found, then its location can be
    explicitly specified by setting the <code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment
    variable to point to the root of the Java installation.  Alternately, you
    can set the <code>JAVA_BIN</code> environment variable to point directly to
    the full path to the "java" (or "java.exe" on Windows) command to invoke.
    On Windows systems, make sure that when setting these environment variables
    that the paths are NOT surrounded with quotation marks.
    <br><br>
    If the startup failure is due to an invalid configuration, then the
    configuration archiving feature of the server may help.  The server will
    automatically keep track of each configuration that it has used in the past
    and will store previous configurations in the archived-config.zip file.
    Note that this functionality is not completely implemented yet, as it will
    only track configuration changes made with the server online (i.e., changes
    made over LDAP or JMX), but in the future it should also have the ability
    to detect changes made with the server offline (i.e., changes made by
    directly editing the configuration file).

    <br><br><br>

    <a name="no_accept"></a>
    <b>The server isn't accepting client connections</b>
    <br>
    If the server is running but isn't accepting client connections, then
    there was likely a problem that prevented the listener from completing its
    initialization.  The most likely reasons for this are:
    <ul>
      <li>There's already something else listening on the specified port</li>
      <li>The uer the server is running as does not have sufficient privileges
          to listen on the specified port</li>
      <li>If SSL is enabled, then there is a problem with the key manager
          and/or trust manager provider configuration.
    </ul>
    In any of these cases, the server error log should provide useful
    information about the underlying failure, and running with assertions
    enabled may provide even more insight into the problem.
    <br><br>
    If the user running the server does not have sufficient privileges to
    listen on the specified port (particularly on UNIX-based systems), then the
    port number should be changed to a value greater than 1024, the server
    should be run as the root user, or the account being used to run the server
    should be given the ability to bind to privileged ports (on Solaris 10,
    this can be accomplished by granting the user the PRIV_NETADDR privilege).

    <br><br><br>

    <a name="unresponsive"></a>
    <b>The server is unresponsive</b>
    <br>
    If the server is online and will accept connections but is not returning
    responses for some reason, then the most likely cause is that the server is
    hung or stuck in a deadlocked state, or that all of the worker threads are
    busy processing other requests.  The most useful tool for debugging the
    server in this case is to capture one or more stack traces so that we can
    see what all of the threads are doing.
    <br><br>
    The best way to obtain a stack trace is to use the jstack utility provided
    with the Java development kit.  Simply issue the command:
    <br>
    <blockquote>
      <code>jstack </code><i>{pid}</i>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    where <i>{pid}</i> is the process ID for the Directory Server process (this
    can be found by running the jps utility provided with the Java development
    kit with no arguments, taking the number next to the DirectoryServer
    process).  On UNIX systems, it may also be possible to obtain the stack
    trace by issuing the command:
    <br>
    <blockquote>
      <code>kill -3 </code><i>{pid}</i>
    </blockquote>

    <br><br><br>

    <a name="error_results"></a>
    <b>The server is returning error results</b>
    <br>
    If the server is responsive but operations are not completing successfully,
    then in most cases the response that the server sends back to the client
    should have sufficient information to understand the cause of the problem.
    These responses should also be written to the server's access log, and it
    may be necessary to look there if the client does not expose the error
    message or result code from the server.  Also, the server will
    intentionally not send any error message to the client for failures that
    occur during bind processing in order to avoid potentially leaking
    information that could be useful to an attacker (e.g., if the bind fails,
    is it because the target user doesn't exist, the password is incorrect,
    the account is locked, etc.).  In these cases, the access log will be the
    only place to find a message explaining the underlying cause for the
    operation failure.
    <br><br>
    If the operations are failing because of an internal error within the
    server, then it is possible that the error log may include information
    about the cause of the problem.  Further, running with assertions enabled
    may make additional debugging information available for understanding the
    underlying cause of the problem.

    <br><br><br>

    <a name="slow"></a>
    <b>The server is very slow</b>
    <br>
    If the server is running properly but seems to be slower than expected,
    then there are a number of things that can be checked:
    <ul>
      <li>If the underlying system itself is starved for resources, then that
          would cause the server to appear sluggish.  If system analysis shows
          that the CPUs are 100% busy, the disks are 100% busy, the system is
          swapping, or there is some other fundamental problem (e.g., a
          hardware failure), then the problem may be with the underlying system
          rather than the Directory Server itself.</li>
      <li>If the JVM has been started with assertions enabled, then it is
          normal to see the server performing more slowly than normal.  With
          assertions enabled, the server will be doing a lot more work (e.g.,
          checking to see if it should write debug messages on every method
          entry).  Restarting with assertions disabled should restore normal
          levels of performance.</li>
      <li>If other debugging facilities have been enabled within the JVM
          (e.g., if certain DTrace probes have been enabled, or if the server
          is running with HPROF or some other profiling enabled), then it is
          normal to see significantly degraded performance.</li>
      <li>If the JVM is spending a lot of time performing garbage collection
          tasks, then performance can suffer.  Running the JVM with the
          "<code>-XX:+PrintGCDetails</code>" argument will cause the server to
          display information about the garbage collection tasks it is
          performing.  If there is a lot of expensive garbage collection
          activity in place, then tuning the JVM (e.g., making more memory
          available to the server, or choosing an alternate garbage collector)
          may help.</li>
    </ul>
    If none of these is the cause of the problem, then profiling may be a good
    way to understand what's happening inside the server.  Any standard Java
    profiling tools may be used, including the HPROF utility provided with the
    Java Development Kit, or a graphical tool like the NetBeans profiler, but
    it may also be useful to enable the profiler built into the Directory
    Server itself.  Instructions for doing this may be found in the OpenDS
    Configuration Guide (<a href="OpenDS-Config-Guide.odt">OpenDocument</a> or
    <a href="OpenDS-Config-Guide.pdf">PDF</a> form) in the section on
    configuring the profiler plugin.

    <br><br><br>

    <a name="je_debugging"></a>
    <b>Berkeley DB JE debugging tips</b>
    <br>
    If you suspect a problem in the way that the server interacts with the
    Berkeley DB Java Edition backend, then there are a number of facilities for
    debugging problems in that area.
    <br><br>
    Some of these tools are provided by the database itself.  For example, the
    <a href="http://www.sleepycat.com/jedocs/GettingStartedGuide/commandlinetools.html">DbDump
    and DbVerify</a> command-line tools may be used to examine the contents of
    the database and verify its integrity.  In addition, the database contains
    its own informational logging subsystem that may be controlled through the
    ds-cfg-database-logging-file-handler-on and ds-cfg-database-logging-level
    configuration attributes as documented in the OpenDS Configuration Guide
    (avaialble in <a href="OpenDS-Config-Guide.odt">OpenDocument</a> or
    <a href="OpenDS-Config-Guide.pdf">PDF</a> form).
    <br><br>
    Additional debugging information may be obtained through the Directory
    Server.  The <code>bin/verify-index.sh</code> script on UNIX-based systems
    or <code>bin\verify-ds.bat</code> batch file on Windows may be used to
    ensure that the contents of the indexes match up with the data actually
    stored in the directory.  It is also possible to issue a query to the
    server and request the "debugsearchindex" attribute (in all lowercase
    characters), which will cause the server to return information about the
    index processing required for that query (e.g., the number of candidates
    identified for each component of the filter and the filter as a whole, as
    well as whether any or all of the search is unindexed).

    <br><br><br>

    <a name="monitoring"></a>
    <b>Obtaining monitoring information</b>
    <br>
    The OpenDS Directory Server exposes a significant amount of monitoring
    information, both over LDAP and JMX.  This monitoring information may
    provide data on the health of the server, how busy it has been, and what
    exactly may be happening at any given time.  Over LDAP, this information
    may be retrieved by performing a subtree search below the "cn=monitor"
    entry.  Monitor information that is currently available includes:
    <ul>
      <li>General statistics, like the time the server was started, the total
          number of connections that have been made, the number of current
          connections, and the maximum number of concurrent connections since
          startup.</li>
      <li>Low-level information about processing in the backend database.</li>
      <li>Information about the system on which the server is running.</li>
      <li>Information about the state of the work queue, the total number of
          requests processed, the current and average backlog of requests
          awaiting processing, and the number of requests that were rejected
          because the queue was too full.</li>
      <li>Information about the LDAP communication performed by the server,
          including the number of operations of each type, and the total number
          of LDAP messages and bytes read from and written to clients.</li>
      <li>A current stack trace of all threads active in the JVM at the time of
          the request.</li>
      <li>Information about the Directory Server version.</li>
    </ul>

    <br><br><br>

    <a name="known_jvm_problems"></a>
    <b>Known problems with the JVM</b>
    <br>
    In some cases, problems experienced while running the Directory Server may
    not be the result of any problems in the Directory Server or the way in
    which you are running it, but rather due to a bug or anomaly in the
    underlying JVM.  Known problems in the JVM that can interfere with the
    operation of the Directory Server include:
    <ul>
      <li>In some cases when running on multi-CPU systems there may be a
          problem with the use of NIO if there are not enough file descriptors
          available.  In this case, the server will throw a number of
          exceptions in the doSelect method and will not be able to accept any
          connections.  The workaround in this case is to update the
          environment so that at least 8193 file descriptors are available to
          the user invoking the Java process.  See
          <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6322825">CR 6322825</a>
          for further details.</li>
      <li>There are notable problems with JMX functionality in certain Java 6
          builds (particularly with regard to the use of JConsole).  Mustang
          builds 86 through 88 (including Java 6 Beta 2) are impacted by this
          problem.  Using a more recent Java 6 build will avoid the issue.  See
          <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6387250">CR 6387250</a>
