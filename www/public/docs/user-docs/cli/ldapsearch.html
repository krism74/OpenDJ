    <br>

    The <code>ldapsearch</code> utility may be used to issue LDAP search
    requests to the Directory Server.  It may also be used to test other
    components of the server like authentication mechanisms, various controls,
    and secure communication mechanisms.

    <br>
<br>

    The command-line usage for this tool is as follows:
    
<blockquote>
      <code>ldapsearch {options} [filter] [attributes...]</code>
    </blockquote>


    The named arguments are listed below.  After all of the named arguments
    have been provided, the next argument should be the search filter, and any
    remaining arguments will signify the set of attributes that should be
    included in the matching entries.  If the <code>--filename</code> option is
    used to specify a file containing one or more search filters, then the
    search filter should not be included as an argument, and all trailing
    arguments will be interpreted as requested attributes.

    <br>
<br>

    If no specific attributes are requested, then all user attributes (that is,
    all non-operational attributes will be returned).  If one or more attribute
    names are listed, then only those attributes will be included in the
    entries that are returned.  There are also a number of special values that
    can be included in this list for various purposes, including:
    
<ul>

      <li>
        <code>1.1</code> -- This indicates that no attributes are to be
        included in the entries returned by the server (i.e., only the entry
        DN will be returned).
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>

      <li>
        <code>*</code> -- This indicates that all user attributes are to be
        included in the entries returned by the server.  This is the default
        behavior if no attributes are list, but it may be required for cases in
        which the user wants to see all user attributes in addition to one or
        more operational attributes.  Note that it may be necessary to enquote
        or escape the asterisk character when used on the command line to
        prevent it from being interpreted by the shell.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>

      <li>
        <code>+</code> -- This indicates that all operational attributes are to
        be included in the entries returned by the server.  By default, no
        operational attributes will be returned.  Note that even if this is
        specified there may be some operational attributes that are not
        automatically for some reason (e.g., if an expensive computation is
        required to construct the value).
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>

      <li>
        <code>@</code><i>objectclass</i> -- This indicates that all attributes
        associated with the specified objectclass should be included in the
        entries returned by the server.  For example, "<code>@person</code>"
        indicates that the server should include all attributes associated with
        the "person" objectclass.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>

    
</ul>


    <br>

    The complete set of named arguments that may be used with the
    <code>ldapsearch</code> tool is as follows:

    
<ul>

      <li>
        <code>-h</code> <i>{address}</i>
        <br>

        <code>--host</code>name <i>{address}</i>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument specifies the address to use to communicate with the
        Directory Server.  It may be an IP address or a resolvable name.  If
        this is not provided, then a default value of "localhost" will be used.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-p</code> <i>{port}</i>
        <br>

        <code>--port</code> <i>{port}</i>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument specifies the port to use to communicate with the
        Directory Server.  It should be an integer value between 1 and 65535,
        inclusive.  If this is not provided, then a default port of 389 will be
        used.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-Z</code>
        <br>

        <code>--useSSL</code>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument indicates that the communication with the Directory
        Server should be protected using SSL.  If this option is provided, then
        the <code>--port</code> option should be used to specify the secure
        port for the server.  This argument must not be used in conjunction
        with the <code>--useStartTLS</code> option.  For more information about
        using SSL, see <a href="ssl-tls.html">this page</a>.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-q</code>
        <br>

        <code>--useStartTLS</code>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument indicates that the communication with the Directory
        Server should be protected using the StartTLS extended operation.  This
        argument must not be used in conjunction with the <code>--useSSL</code>
        option.  For more information about using StartTLS, see
        <a href="ssl-tls.html">this page</a>.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-D</code> <i>{dn}</i>
        <br>

        <code>--bindDN</code> <i>{dn}</i>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument specifies the DN to use when binding to the Directory
        Server through simple authentication.  It is not required when using
        SASL authentication or if no authentication is to be performed.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-w</code> <i>{password}</i>
        <br>

        <code>--bindPassword</code> <i>{password}</i>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument specifies the password to use when authenticating to the
        Directory Server.  It is used for simple authentication, as well as for
        password-based SASL mechanisms like CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5, and PLAIN.
        It is not required if no authentication is to be performed.  This
        option must not be used in conjunction with the
        <code>--bindPasswordFile</code> argument.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-j</code> <i>{path}</i>
        <br>

        <code>--bindPasswordFile</code> <i>{path}</i>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument specifies the path to a file containing the password to
        use when authenticating to the Directory Server.  It is used for simple
        authentication, as well as for password-based SASL mechanisms like
        CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5, and PLAIN.  It is not required if no
        authentication is to be performed.  This option must not be used in
        conjunction with the <code>--bindPassword</code> argument.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-b</code> <i>{dn}</i>
        <br>

        <code>--baseDN</code> <i>{dn}</i>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument specifies the base DN to use for the search operation.
        If a file containing multiple filters is provided using the
        <code>--filename</code> option, then this base DN will be used for all
        of the searches.  This is a required argument.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-s</code> <i>{scope}</i>
        <br>

        <code>--searchScope</code> <i>{scope}</i>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument specifies the scope to use for the search operation.  Its
        value must be one of "base", "one", "sub", or "subordinate".  If this
        argument is not provided, then a default value of "sub" will be used.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-f</code> <i>{path}</i>
        <br>

        <code>--filename</code> <i>{path}</i>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument specifies the path to a file containing one or more
        filters to use when processing the search operation.  If there are to
        be multiple filters, then the file should be structured with one filter
        per line, and all of those searches will be performed using the same
        connection to the server in the order they appear in the filter file.
        If this option is used, then any trailing arguments will be treated as
        separate attributes; otherwise the first trailing argument must be the
        search filter.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-r</code>
        <br>

        <code>--useSASLExternal</code>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument specifies that the client should authenticate using the
        SASL EXTERNAL mechanism, which will attempt to identify the client
        using an SSL certificate that it presents to the Directory Server.  If
        this option is used, then the <code>--keyStorePath</code> argument must
        also be provided to specify the path to the client keystore, and either
        the <code>--useSSL</code> or the <code>--useStartTLS</code> option must
        be used to establish a secure communication channel with the server.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-o</code> <i>{option}</i>
        <br>

        <code>--saslOption</code> <i>{option}</i>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument may be used to specify an option for use when performing
        SASL authentication.  Multiple SASL options may be provided by using
        this argument multiple times, once for each option.  See
        <a href="sasl-auth.html">this page</a> for more information on using
        SASL authentication in OpenDS clients.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-X</code>
        <br>

        <code>--trustAll</code>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument indicates that the client should trust any SSL
        certificate that the server may present when performing secure
        communication with either SSL or the StartTLS extended operation.  This
        is convenient for testing purposes, but it is generally not recommended
        for use in a production environment because it could make the client
        susceptible to a man-in-the-middle attack.  If this option is not
        provided, then the <code>--trustStorePath</code> option should be used
        to specify the path to a trust store to consult in order to determine
        whether to trust a server certificate.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-K</code> <i>{path}</i>
        <br>

        <code>--keyStorePath</code> <i>{option}</i>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument specifies the path to a client key store file that should
        be used for secure communication via SSL or the StartTLS extended
        operation.  This option is generally only required if the client needs
        to present its own certificate to the server, such as when performing
        SASL external authentication.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-W</code> <i>{password}</i>
        <br>

        <code>--keyStorePassword</code> <i>{password}</i>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument specifies the password needed to access the contents of
        the client key store.  This is only required if the
        <code>--keyStorePath</code> option is used.  This option must not be
        used in conjunction with the <code>--keyStorePasswordFile</code>
        argument.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-u</code><code></code> <i>{path}</i>
    <br>
    <code>--keyStorePasswordFile</code> <i>{path}</i>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument specifies the path to a file containing the password
        needed to access the contents of the client key store.  This is only
        required if the <code>--keyStorePath</code> option is used.  This
        option must not be used in conjunction with the
        <code>--keyStorePassword</code> argument.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-P</code> <i>{path}</i>
        <br>

        <code>--trustStorePath</code> <i>{option}</i>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument specifies the path to a clien trust store file that
        should be used for secure communication via SSL or the StartTLS
        extended operation.  This argument is not needed if the
        <code>--trustAll</code> option is not used, although it is recommended
        that a trust store be used when working in a production environment.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>--trustStorePassword</code> <i>{password}</i>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument specifies the password needed to access the contents of
        the client trust store.  This is only required if the
        <code>--trustStorePath</code> option is used and the specified trust
        store requires a password in order to access its contents (most trust
        stores do not require this).  This option must not be used in
        conjunction with the <code>--trustStorePasswordFile</code>
        argument.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-U</code><code></code> <i>{path}</i>
    <br>
    <code>--trustStorePasswordFile</code> <i>{path}</i>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument specifies the path to a file containing the password
        needed to access the contents of the client trust store.  This is only
        required if the <code>--trustStorePath</code> option is used and the
        specified trust store requires a password in order to access its
        contents (most trust stores do not require this).  This option must not
        be used in conjunction with the <code>--trustStorePassword</code>
        argument.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-Y</code> <i>{authzID}</i>
        <br>

        <code>--proxyAs</code> <i>{authzID}</i>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument specifies that the client should use the proxied
        authorization control to specify the identity of the user as whom the
        operations should be performed.  This will use version 2 of the proxied
        authorization control as defined in
        <a href="../../../standards/rfc4370.txt">RFC 4370</a>.  The value of
        the argument should be an authorization ID in the form "dn:" followed
        by the DN of the target user (e.g.,
        "dn:uid=john.doe,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com"), or "u:" followed by the
        username (e.g., "u:john.doe").  If this argument is not provided, then
        proxied authorization will not be used.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-E</code>
        <br>

        <code>--reportAuthzID</code>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument indicates that the client should include the
        authorization identity request control (as defined in
        <a href="../../../standards/rfc3829.txt">RFC 3829</a>) in the bind
        request so that the server will return the corresponding authorization
        ID when authentication has completed.  The authorization ID returned by
        the server will be displayed to the client as soon as authentication
        has completed (the line containing the authorization ID will be
        prefixed with a "<code>#</code>" character, making it a comment if the
        output is to be interpreted as LDIF).
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>--usePasswordPolicyControl</code>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument indicates that the client should include the password
        policy request control in the bind request so that the server will
        return the corresponding result control in the bind response.  This may
        be used to obtain information about any warnings or errors with regard
        to the state of the client's account.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-C</code> <i>{psearchSpec}</i>
        <br>

        <code>--persistentSearch</code> <i>{psearchSpec}</i>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument specifies that the client should include the persistent
        search control (as defined in
        <a href="../../../standards/draft-ietf-ldapext-psearch.txt">draft-ietf-ldapext-psearch</a>)
        in the search request in order to obtain information about changes that
        are made to entries matching the provided search criteria.  The value
        for this argument must be in the form
        
    <blockquote>
          ps[:<i>{changetype}</i>[:<i>{changesonly}</i>[:<i>{entrychangecontrols}</i>]]]
        </blockquote>

        The elements of this value include:
        
    <ul>

          <li>"<code>ps</code>" -- This is static text and must always be
              present.</li>

          <li>"<i>{changetype}</i>" -- This indicates the type(s) of changes for
              which the client wishes to receive notification.  It may be any
              of "add", "del", "mod", or "moddn", or it may be "all" to
              register for all change types, or it may be a comma-separated
              list to register for multiple specific change types.  If this
              element is not provided, then it will default to including all
              change types.</li>

          <li>"<i>{changesonly}</i>" -- This should be "<code>true</code>" if
              the client should only be notified of changes that occur to
              matching entries once the search is registered, or
              "<code>false</code>" if the server should also send all existing
              entries in the server that match the provided search criteria.
              If this element is not provided, then it will default to only
              returning entries for updates that occurred since the search was
              registered.</li>

          <li>"<i>{entrychangecontrols}</i>" -- This should be
              "<code>true</code>" if the server should include the entry change
              notification control in entries sent to the client as a result of
              changes, or "<code>false</code>" if the entry change notification
              control should not be included.  If this element is not provided,
              then it will default to including the entry change notification
              controls.</li>

        
    </ul>

        For example, the value "<code>ps:add,del:true:true</code>" will return
        only entries matching the search criteria that have been added or
        deleted since the time that the persistent search was registered, and
        those entries will include entry change notification controls.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>--assertionFilter</code> <i>{filter}</i>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument specifies that the client should use the LDAP assertion
        control (as defined in 
        <a href="../../../standards/rfc4528.txt">RFC 4528</a>) to indicate that
        the operation should only be processed if the assertion contained in
        the provided filter is true.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>--matchedValuesFilter</code> <i>{filter}</i>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument specifies that the client should use the LDAP matched
        values control (as defined in
        <a href="../../../standards/rfc3876.txt">RFC 3876</a>) in order to
        indicate that only attribute values matching the specified filter
        should be included in the search results.  This argument may be
        provided multiple times in order to specify multiple matched values
        filters.
        <br>
    <br>

        <code>-J</code> <i>{controlSpec}</i>
        <br>

        <code>--control</code> <i>{controlSpec}</i>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument specifies that the client should include the specified
        control in search request(s) sent to the server.  This makes it
        possible to include arbitrary request controls that the client may not
        directly support.  The value for this argument must be in the form:
        
    <blockquote>
          <i>{oid}</i>[:<i>{criticality}</i>[:{value}|::<i>{b64value}</i>|:&lt;<i>{fileurl}</i>]]
        </blockquote>

        The elements of this value include:
        
    <ul>

          <li>"<i>{oid}</i>" -- This specifies the OID for the control.  For
              certain types of controls, a text name may be used instead of the
              numeric OID (for search operations, this includes "subentries"
              to use the LDAP subentries control and "managedsait" for the
              manage DSA IT control).  This element must be provided.</li>

          <li>"<i>{criticality}</i>" -- This should be either
              "<code>true</code>" if the control should be marked critical
              (meaning that the server should not process the operation unless
              it can meet the requirements of this control) or
              "<code>false</code>" if the control should not be marked
              critical.  If this is not provided, then the control will not be
              marked critical.</li>

          <li>"<i>{value}</i>" -- This specifies the value for the control.
              This form should only be used if the value can be expressed as a
              string.  It must not be used in conjunction with either the
              "::<i>{b64value}</i>" or ":&lt;<i>{fileurl}</i>" forms.  If none
              of these options is present, then the control will not have a
              value.</li>

          <li>"<i>{b64value}</i>" -- This specifies the value for the control
              in base64-encoded form.  It must not be used in conjunction with
              either the ":<i>{value}</i>" or ":&lt;<i>{fileurl}</i>" forms.
              If none of these options is present, then the control will not
              have a value.</li>

          <li>"<i>{fileurl}</i>" -- This specifies a URL that references a file
              from which the value of the control should be taken.  It must not
              be used in conjunction with either the ":<i>{value}</i>" or
              "::<i>{b64value}</i>" forms.  If none of these options is
              present, then the control will not have a value.</li>

        
    </ul>

        For example, the value "<code>1.2.3.4:true:foo</code>" will include a
        critical control with an OID of "1.2.3.4" and a string value of "foo".
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-V</code> <i>{version}</i>
        <br>

        <code>--version</code> <i>{version}</i>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument specifies the LDAP protocol version that the client
        should use when communicating with the Directory Server.  The value
        must be either "2" (for LDAPv2 communication) or "3" (for LDAPv3).  If
        this argument is not provided, then the client will use LDAPv3.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-i</code> <i>{charset}</i>
        <br>

        <code>--encoding</code> <i>{charset}</i>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument specifies the character set that the client will use to
        interpret the information that should be used to generate the search
        request.  If this is not provided, then a default of "UTF-8" will be
        used.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-a</code> <i>{policy}</i>
        <br>

        <code>--dereferencePolicy</code> <i>{policy}</i>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument specifies the policy that should be requested when
        attempting to dereference aliases.  The value must be one of "never",
        "always", "search", or "find".  If this argument is not provided, then
        a default of "never" will be used.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-A</code>
        <br>

        <code>--typesOnly</code>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument indicates that the server should only include attribute
        type names in matching entries but should not include the attribute
        values.  If this argument is not provided, then both attribute names
        and values will be included in the matching entries.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-z</code> <i>{numEntries}</i>
        <br>

        <code>--sizeLimit</code> <i>{numEntries}</i>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument specifies the maximum number of matching entries that the
        server should return to the client.  If this is not provided, then
        there will be no maximum requested by the client.  Note that the server
        may enforce a lower size limit than the one requested by the client.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-l</code> <i>{numSeconds}</i>
        <br>

        <code>--timeLimit</code> <i>{numSeconds}</i>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument specifies the maximum length of time in seconds that
        the server should spend processing any search request.  If this is not
        provided, then there will be no time limit requested by the client.
        Note that the server may enforce a lower time limit than the one
        requested by the client.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-T</code>
        <br>

        <code>--dontWrap</code>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument indicates that the client should not wrap long lines when
        displaying matching entries.  If this is not provided, then long lines
        will be wrapped (in a manner compatible with the LDIF specification) to
        fit on an 80-column terminal.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>--countEntries</code>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument indicates that the client should count the number of
        entries returned by the server and display it as a comment when the
        search has completed, and that the number of matching entries should
        also be used as the exit code for the tool.  If the
        <code>--filename is used to specify the path to a file
        containing multiple search filters, then the total number of matching
        entries for all searches will be displayed and used as the exit code.
        <br>
    <br>

      </code></li>


      <li>
        <code>-c</code>
        <br>

        <code>--continueOnError</code>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument indicates that the client should continue processing even
        if an error occurs.  This applies primarily in the case in which the
        <code>--filename</code> option is used to specify the path to a file
        containing multiple search filters and an error occurs while processing
        one of the searches defined in that file.  If the
        <code>--continueOnError</code> option is provided, then processing will
        continue with the next search filter; otherwise the tool will exit
        before all searches have been completed.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-n</code>
        <br>

        <code>--dry-run</code><br>
    <br>

        This argument indicates that the client should report what it would do
        but should not actually perform any searches or communicate with the
        server in any way.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-v</code>
        <br>

        <code>--verbose</code>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument indicates that the client should provide verbose
        information about the processing that it is performing and the
        interaction that it has with the server.
        <br>
    <br>

      </li>


      <li>
        <code>-H</code>
        <br>

        <code>--help</code>
        <br>
    <br>

        This argument will display usage information for the
        <code>ldapsearch</code> utility and will exit without attempting to
        perform any additional processing.
        <br>
