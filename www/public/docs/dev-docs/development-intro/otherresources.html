    <br>
    Although much of the OpenDS content is hosted on the java.net site, there
    is some content which is hosted elsewhere for some reason.  In most cases,
    this content requires additional server-side processing for features that
    are not offered by java.net in a manner that meets our needs.

    <br><br>
    <b>Daily Builds</b>
    <br><br>
    Every night at about 11:30 pm US Central time, we have an automated process
    which checks out the latest version of the OpenDS source code, builds it,
    and runs a full set of tests on the server.  This provides a number of
    benefits, including:

    <ul>
      <li>It ensures that the code actually builds properly and that no one
          inadvertently committed code that failed to compile.<br><br></li>
      <li>It provides a means of running a full set of tests against the server
          (potentially, including tests which are too time consuming to expect
          developers to run before each commit) to identify any failures that
          may require investigation.<br><br></li>
      <li>It provides a way for users to obtain a recent build of the server
          without having to check out and build the code for themselves, and
          without the need to wait for the next weekly build.<br><br></li>
    </ul>

    Whenever the daily build process completes, it will send an e-mail message
    to the <a href="mailto:daily-builds@opends.dev.java.net">daily-builds@opends.dev.java.net</a>
    mailing list with information about the success or failure of the build and
    information about where to obtain it.  Our daily builds are located at
    <a href="http://builds.opends.org/daily-builds/">http://builds.opends.org/daily-builds/</a>
    and are arranged by date.  The latest daily build is always available at
    <a href="http://builds.opends.org/daily-builds/latest/">http://builds.opends.org/daily-builds/latest/</a>.  When viewing information about the latest
    daily build, you will be able to easily download the build, view the unit
    test and code coverage reports, access Javadoc documentation, and launch
    the Java Web Start installer for that build.

    <br><br>
    <b>Source Browser</b>
    <br><br>
    We provide a source browser which provides a convenient way to access the
    contents of the OpenDS Subversion repository at
    <a href="http://builds.opends.org/source/">http://builds.opends.org/source/</a>.
    This source browser is powered by
    <a href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/project/opengrok/">OpenGrok</a>,
    which is also used by the OpenSolaris project.  It provides a convenient
    way for individuals to search and browse the OpenDS repository content
    without having to check it out for themselves.  It also provides formatted
    views of the source code which are cross-referenced so that it is easy to
    find the definition and usages for various objects.

    <br><br>
    This source browser is a very convenient way for someone to look at and get
    familiar with the OpenDS source code and understand how the components tie
    together without the need to actually check out the complete set of code
    for themselves.  This could be useful, for example, by someone wishing to
    write a plugin or some other type of extension for the server in order to
    get clarification on how to use a particular method or find examples of
    other cases where it may be used in the server.
