    <br>
    The OpenDS source repository should have virtually everything that you need
    in order to perform the build and run the tests, so once you have checked
    the code out of the repository you are ready to build it.  The only other
    thing that you need is a Java development kit installation for Java SE 5
    or higher (it should always work with Java SE 5 and Java SE 6 releases, and
    it also appears to work properly with Java SE 7 builds, although given that
    it is still very early in the development process Java SE 7 builds may not
    always work seamlessly).

    <br><br>
    To perform a basic build of OpenDS, simply run the <code>build.sh</code>
    shell script on UNIX-based systems or <code>build.bat</code> on Windows.
    If you don't provide any arguments, then it will simply compile the source
    code and create a build of the server.  Note that in some cases, the build
    script may be able to automatically detect the location of your Java
    environment (particularly on UNIX-based systems when a Java 5 or higher
    executable is in your PATH), but if you get an error message indicating
    that a suitable Java environment could not be found, or if you would like
    to use a different Java environment than the one that is selected by
    default, then you will need to set the <code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment
    variable to the path to the appropriate Java installation.

    <br><br>
    Running the build script with no arguments will default to using the
    "<code>package</code>" target.  Other targets of interest include:
    <ul>
      <li><code>clean</code> -- Removes any files that had been created during
          a previous build.<br><br></li>
      <li><code>compile</code> -- Performs a minimal compilation of the Java
          source files, but do not build a usable server.<br><br></li>
      <li><code>dsml</code> -- Build a WAR file containing the DSML
          gateway.<br><br></li>
      <li><code>checkstyle</code> -- Perform basic style validation on the
          Java source files.<br><br></li>
      <li><code>javadoc</code> -- Generates Javadoc documentation from the
          Java source files.<br><br></li>
      <li><code>test</code> -- Run the default set of unit tests (all but the
          "slow" tests) against the server.<br><br></li>
      <li><code>testwithcoverage</code> -- Run the default set of unit tests
          against the server and generate a code coverage report.<br><br></li>
      <li><code>testall</code> -- Run the complete set of unit tests against
          the server.<br><br></li>
      <li><code>testallwithcoverage</code> -- Run the complete set of unit
          tests against the server and generate a code coverage
          report.<br><br></li>
      <li><code>testcustom</code> -- Run a custom (user-defined) set of unit
          tests against the server.<br><br></li>
      <li><code>testcustomwithcoverage</code> -- Run a custom set of unit tests
          against the server and generate a code coverage report.<br><br></li>
      <li><code>precommit</code> -- Combines a number of build targets,
          including clean, compile, package, dsml, checkstyle, javadoc, and
          test, which must all pass cleanly before code is suitable for
          being committed.<br><br></li>
      <li><code>all</code> -- Combines virtually all build targets, including
          clean, compile, package, dsml, checkstyle, javadoc, and
          testallwithcoverage.<br><br></li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <b>Java Properties to Use in the Build Process</b>
    <br><br>
    The build script recognizes a number of Java properties that may be used to
    alter the way that the build is performed.  They may be provided to the
    build process using the "<code>-D</code>" argument.  This argument must be
    immediately followed by the name of the property, an equal sign, and the
    property value (optionally enclosed in quotation marks).  There should not
    be any spaces at all in the property string, either between the
    "<code>-D</code>" identifier and the property name, or between the property
    name and property value, like "<code>-DTESTASSERT=true</code>".

    <br><br>
    The supported properties that may be used include:
    <ul>
      <li><code>DEBUG_BUILD</code> -- This may be used to indicate whether to
          generate a debug build.  A debug build may contain code that is not
          included in a non-debug build.  The value of this property should be
          either "<code>true</code>" or "<code>false</code>".<br><br></li>
      <li><code>MEM</code> -- This may be used to specify the amount of memory
          that each JVM instance should use during the build process (if test
          cases are to be included, then a second JVM instance will be used to
          run those tests).  The value of this parameter should be an integer
          followed by a unit of either "M" for megabytes or "G" for gigabytes.
          The default value is "<code>128M</code>".  Increasing the amount of
          memory available to the JVM may allow the build to go faster.  In
          some low-memory conditions it may be possible to use a smaller value,
          but if the value is set too low, then it may result in out-of-memory
          errors.<br><br></li>
      <li><code>TESTASSERT</code> -- This is used to indicate that assertions
          should be enabled while running the test cases.  Assertions are
          automatically enabled when running all test cases, but not when
          running the default set of test cases.<br><br></li>
      <li><code>test.packages</code> -- When used in conjunction with the
          <code>testcustom</code> or <code>testcustomwithcoverage</code>
          target, this is used to specify the packages whose test cases should
          be run.  If multiple packages are to be specified, then they should
          be separated by commas.<br><br></li>
      <li><code>test.classes</code> -- When used in conjunction with the
          <code>testcustom</code> or <code>testcustomwithcoverage</code>
          target, this is used to specify the classes whose test cases should
          be run.  If multiple classes are to be specified, then they should
          be separated by commas.<br><br></li>
      <li><code>test.methods</code> -- When used in conjunction with the
          <code>testcustom</code> or <code>testcustomwithcoverage</code>
          target, this is used to specify the individual test methods that
          should be run.  Each method should be specified as the
          fully-qualified class name followed by a period and the method name.
          If multiple methods are to be specified, then they should be
          separated by commas.<br><br></li>
      <li><code>org.opends.test.suppressOutput</code> -- This indicates whether
          the build process should produce a minimal set of output when running
          the unit tests.  The value should be either "<code>true</code>" or 
          "<code>false</code>".<br><br></li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <b>Components Generated During the Build Process</b>
    <br><br>
    When the Directory Server build process is running, it generates files
    below the <code>build</code> subdirectory.  Notable files and directories
    generated during the build process include:
    <ul>
      <li><code>build/classes</code> -- Compiled server classes<br><br></li>
      <li><code>build/package/OpenDS-0.1</code> -- A directory containing a
          usable server package (i.e., you can run the server from this
          directory)<br><br></li>
      <li><code>build/package/OpenDS-0.1.zip</code> -- A zipped version of the
          <code>build/package/OpenDS-0.1</code> directory)<br><br></li>
      <li><code>build/package/OpenDS-0.1-DSML.war</code> -- A WAR file
          containing the built DSML gateway<br><br></li>
      <li><code>build/javadoc/index.html</code> -- Javadoc documentation for
          the compiled server and DSML gateway<br><br></li>
      <li><code>build/unit-tests/report/OpenDS/default.html</code> -- An
          HTML-formatted report with information about the unit test
          processing<br><br></li>
      <li><code>build/unit-tests/package</code> -- An directory containing the
          server deployment used to run the unit tests<br><br></li>
      <li><code>build/coverage/reports/unit/index.html</code> -- An
          HTML-formatted report of the code coverage obtained while running
          the unit tests<br><br></li>
    </ul>


    <br>
    <b>Building the Java Web Start Installer</b>
    <br><br>
    The QuickSetup utility is a graphical tool that may be used to perform the
    initial configuration for the Directory Server when run from a server
    installation, but it may also be used to install and configure the server
    using Java Web Start.  In order to do that, it is necessary to package the
    server in a special manner (using signed JAR files with specific names),
    and it is also necessary to generate a JNLP file that is used to provide
    the client with all the information needed to download and run the tool,
    including specific information about the web server that will be used to
    host the files.

    <br><br>
    The repository does contain a script that may be used to generate a package
    suitable for deploying to a web server.  Note, however, that this is a
    shell script and is not integrated into the ant build process.  The reason
    for this is that it has dependencies on the Sun Java SDK installation and
    must execute native utilities.  It is also not available for use on Windows
    systems because the batch file syntax is not as rich as the shell
    scripting framework available on UNIX systems.

    <br><br>
    The shell script to use when generating the Java Web Start archive is
    <code>resource/webstart/create-webstart-standalone.sh</code>, and it should
    be run without any arguments.  By default, it will create an archive
    suitable the default deployment at
    <a href="http://builds.opends.org/install/QuickSetup.jnlp">http://builds.opends.org/install/QuickSetup.jnlp</a>.
    A number of environment variables may be used to customize its behavior,
    including:
    <ul>
      <li><code>JAVA_HOME</code> -- This should be set to the root of the JDK
          5.0 or higher installation to use (a JRE installation will not be
          sufficient).<br><br></li>
      <li><code>PROTOCOL</code> -- This should be used to specify the protocol
          that clients should use to access the JNLP file.  The default is
          "<code>http</code>", but it may also be set to
          "<code>https</code>".<br><br></li>
      <li><code>ADDRESS</code> -- This specifies the address of the server that
          will host the Java Web Start archive.  The default value is
          "builds.opends.org".<br><br></li>
      <li><code>PORT</code> -- This specifies the port number of the web server
          that will host the Java Web Start archive.  The default value is
          an empty string, which will mean that clients should use the default
          of "80" for the HTTP protocol, or "443" for HTTPS.<br><br></li>
      <li><code>BASE_PATH</code> -- This specifies the path (relative to the
          web document root) of the directory containing the JNLP file.  The
          default value is "<code>/install</code>".<br><br></li>
      <li><code>JNLP_FILENAME</code> -- This specifies the name of the JNLP
          file that may be requested by clients to launch the QuickSetup
          utility.  The default value is
          "<code>QuickSetup.jnlp</code>".<br><br></li>
    </ul>

    When this script completes, all files needed for the Java Web Start archive
    may be found in the <code>build/webstart/install</code> directory.  The
    contents of this directory (including its subdirectories) may be copied
    into the appropriate directory on the target web server.
