Unit tests in OpenDS is designed for developers to quickly identify
and fix changes in the code that causes regressions. It usually
involves
writing test cases that will try to execute every line of code in all
methods. OpenDS uses the <a href="http://testng.org">TestNG</a>
open source testing framework.<br>
<h3>Running the Tests</h3>
There are groups of unit tests for OpenDS. Most test cases that run in
a short
amount of time belong to the default test group. However, there are
some more
intensive test cases that require more time to run. These tests belong
to the
"slow" test group which are only run when necessary to make sure build
times
are not excessively long. These tests only run for the "testall",
"testallwithcoverage", and "all" build targets. By default, all test
classes in
the
<code>org.opends.server</code> package will be executed.
To run the default test group from the command line, use the command:
<blockquote><code>./build.sh test</code> on UNIX<br>
  <code>./build.bat test</code> on Windows
</blockquote>
To run all the tests including the slow test group from the command
line, use
the command:
<blockquote><code>./build.sh testall</code> on UNIX<br>
  <code>./build.bat testall</code> on Windows
</blockquote>
The tests can also be invoked from within NetBeans. Please see the
<a href="http://blogs.sun.com/xzajo/entry/test_ng_plugin_for_netbeans">TestNG
plugin for NetBeans 5.0 page</a> for instructions on how to download
and install the
plugin.
TestNG plugins for <a href="http://testng.org/doc/idea.html">IDEA</a>
or
<a href="http://testng.org/doc/eclipse.html">Eclipse IDE</a> are also
available.<br>
<blockquote>NOTE: In order to run tests from within NetBeans or another
IDE, provide the JVM argument <code>-Dorg.opends.server.BuildRoot=${basedir}</code>
in run/debug properties. Replace ${basedir} with the path to the
directory where OpenDS was checked out from SVN.
</blockquote>
TestNG will print out the test results when the tests are finished. It
also
provides detailed HTML based reports listing all test cases that were
run
along with their results. The reports are located at
<code>build/unit-tests/report/OpenDS/index.html</code><br>
<br>
You can also specify the tests you wish to run in groups, packages, classes,
and
methods. Just use the following
command line arguments:<br>
<table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="80%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td> <strong>Argument</strong> </td>
      <td> <strong>Value Format</strong> </td>
      <td> <strong>Description</strong> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> <code>-Dtest.groups</code> </td>
      <td> <code>exclude/include=group_name,
&lt;exclude/include=group_name, ...&gt;</code><br>
      </td>
      <td> Use this to specify the group of test you wish to include or
exclude from the suite. If this argument is not specified, all tests
will run no matter what group they are in. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> <code>-Dtest.packages</code> </td>
      <td> <code>package_name, &lt;package_name, ...&gt;</code>
Regular expressions can also be used. </td>
      <td> This will run all the test classes in the package(s)
specified. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> <code>-Dtest.classes</code> </td>
      <td> <code>class_name, &lt;class name, ...&gt;</code> Regular
expressions can also be used. </td>
      <td> This will run all the test methods in the class(es)
specified. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> <code>-Dtest.methods</code> </td>
      <td> <code>class_name1.method_name1, &lt;method_name2, ... &lt;;
class_name2.method_name1, method_name2, ...&gt;&gt;</code> Regular
expressions can also be used. </td>
      <td> This will run only the test methods specified from the test
classes spcified. </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
Examples:
<blockquote> <code>./build.sh test
-Dtest.packages=org.opends.server.core,org.opends.server.protocols.*</code>
</blockquote>
Run all tests classes in the org.opends.server.core packages as well as
all the
test classes in the packages that are under
org.opends.server.protocols.
<blockquote> <code>./build.sh testwithcoverage
-Dtest.packages=org.opends.server.tasks
-Dtest.classes=org.opends.server.schema.GuideSyntaxTest</code>
</blockquote>
Run all tests classes in the package org.opends.server.tasks along with
the
org.opends.server.schema.GuideSyntaxTest test class. A coverage report
will also
be generated.
<blockquote> <code>./build.sh test
-Dtest.methods=org.opends.server.protocols.ldap.TestModifyRequestProtocolOp.testEncodeDecode,testConstructors;org.opends.server.tasks.TestBackupAndRestore.testBackups</code>
</blockquote>
Only run the test method testEncodeDecode and testConstructors in the
test class
org.opends.server.protocols.ldap.TestModifyRequestProtocolOp along with
the
testBackups method in the org.opends.server.tasks.TestBackupAndRestore
test
class.
<br>
<h3>Code Coverage</h3>
Code coverage information is also available with EMMA, the open source
code
coverage toolkit. To generate code coverage reports for the default
test group,
simply issue the command:
<blockquote><code>./build.sh testwithcoverage</code> on UNIX<br>
  <code>./build.bat testwithcoverage</code> on Windows
</blockquote>
To generate code coverage reports for the all tests,
simply issue the command:
<blockquote><code>./build.sh testallwithcoverage</code> on UNIX<br>
  <code>./build.bat testallwithcoverage</code> on Windows
</blockquote>
The HTML based coverage reports can be found at
<code>build/coverage/report/index.html</code>.
<br>
<br>
A coverage report is also generated that shows coverage just for the lines of
code that are added or changed locally. This report merges the coverage
information (if any) with the results from a diff of the local changes from
the latest revision in the repository. With this report, you can quickly find
out how much of the local code modifications are covered by unit tests. The
HTML based coveragediff report can be found at
<code>build/diff/report/index.html</code>
<br><br>
By default, the coveragediff report is generated for all files under the build
root. To change the default diff path, use the command line argument
<code>-Dtest.diff.srcpath=path_to_diff</code>.
<br><br>
To disable generating the coveragediff report include the command line argument
<code>-Dtest.diff.disable=</code> with the test*withcoverage targets.
<blockquote>NOTE: The coveragediff utiity depends on having the SVN executable
to be in your path. To manually specify the path to the svn executable, use
the command line argument <code>-Dtest.diff.svnpath=path_to_svn</code></blockquote>
<h3>Writing Tests</h3>
The unit test source directory is located in
<code>tests/unit-tests-testng</code> and follows the same structure as
the OpenDS source code. Please put the test classes in the same
packages
as the classes they are testing. <br>
<br>
TestNG uses <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/annotations.html">
Java Annotations</a>. Please refer to the
<a href="http://testng.org/doc/documentation-main.html#annotations">TestNG
documentation</a>
for a list of available annotations. Test case methods are annotated
with <code>@Test</code>
before the method signature. These test cases are run as part of the
default
test group. For
slow test cases that should only run as part of the "slow" test group,
use the
<code>groups</code>
attribute for the <code>@Test</code> annotation with the value of
<code>"slow"</code>.
(ie. <code>@Test(groups = { "slow" })</code>).<br>
<br>
The TestNG configuration file might need to be modified for the new
tests to
run.
The file is located at <code>ext/testng/testng.xml</code>. Make sure
the package
in
which your test classes belongs to is included in the <code>
&lt;packages&gt;</code> tag.
Test classes can also be specified explicitly in the <code>
&lt;classes&gt;</code> tag.
Please keep the configuration file as simple as possible. For example,
when
TestNG provides
the option of specifying an option in the configuration file or in the
test code
itself, favor
using the test code.<br>
<h3>Test Environment</h3>
Not only does test classes have access to all the internal and external
API of
OpenDS,
it can also start an instance of OpenDS for running protocol level
tests. The
<code>TestCaseUtils</code> class includes several methods for
manipulating the
test
environment. The test environment server root is located at
<code>build/package</code>.<br>
<br>
When the <code>startServer()</code> method is called to start the test
environment server,
it applies any configuration changes in the LDIF file at
<code>tests/unit-tests-testng/resource/config-changes.ldif</code> on
top of the
default
server configuration. LDIF adds, deletes, modifies to the configuration
can be
included
in this file to tailor the test environment server to special test
cases.<br>
<h3>Running the test instance with a given port number</h3>
The port number used by the test OpenDS instance is a random port
number, this is usually a good thing because it allows to run the test
even if the usual LDAP port numbers are currently used by another
OpenDS instance or another server. However to debug a problem detected
by a given test it might be usefull to stop the OpenDS instance using a
debugger and to query the LDAP server, in such case it is possible to
set the port number used by the test instance by setting the JVM&nbsp;
argument : org.opends.server.LdapPort to any valid port number. For
example use :<br>
<code style="font-family: monospace;">./build.sh testall -D</code><span
 style="font-family: monospace;">org.opends.server.LdapPort=1389</span><br>
