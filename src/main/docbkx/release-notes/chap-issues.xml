  <title>Key Fixes</title>

  <note><!-- TODO: reconsider when 2.4.x is no longer supported. -->
   <para>OpenDJ 2.6.0 includes important improvements to replication.
   Replication remains fully compatible with earlier versions. However, some
   operations that work fine with OpenDJ 2.6.0, such as replicating large
   groups and replicating high volumes of adds and deletes, can cause
   issues for earlier versions. Make sure you upgrade all servers to 2.6.0
   before allowing clients to take advantage of write operations that could
   cause trouble for older servers.</para>
  </note>

  <para>The following important bugs were fixed in this release.</para>

  <title>Limitations</title>

  <para>Release <?eval ${docTargetVersion}?> has the following
  limitations.</para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>OpenDJ directory server provides full LDAP v3 support, except for
    alias dereferencing, and limited support for LDAPv2.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>When you configure account lockout as part of password policy,
    OpenDJ locks an account after the specified number of consecutive
    authentication failures. Account lockout is not transactional across a
    replication topology, however. Global account lockout occurs as soon as
    the authentication failure times have been replicated.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>OpenDJ is not fully integrated with Microsoft Windows, yet OpenDJ
    directory server can be run as a service, and thus displayed in the
    Windows Services Control Panel.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>OpenDJ replication is designed to permit an unlimited number
    of replication servers in your topology. Project testing has, however,
    focused only on topologies of up to eight replication servers.</para>
   </listitem>

   <listitem>
    <para>OpenDJ plugin extensions must follow the guidelines set forth in
    the <filename>README</filename> file delivered in
    <filename>opendj/example-plugin.zip</filename>. When developing your
    extension, aim to remain loosely coupled with any particular version of
    OpenDJ. Libraries used must be installed in
    <filename>opendj/lib/extensions/</filename> (or bundle them in your
    .jar). Keep your configuration separate from the server configuration.
    Also, unless you are reusing standard schema definitions, keep your
    schema definitions separate as well.</para>

    <para>This can affect how your extension works after upgrade. In
    particular <literal>opendj-accountchange-handler-1.0.0</literal> does
    not work with OpenDJ 2.6.0 after upgrade (<link xlink:show="new"
    xlink:href="https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/OPENDJ-991"
    >OPENDJ-991</link>). See that issue for notes on how make that version
    of the extension work with OpenDJ 2.6.0.</para>

   <!-- This hardware is EOL.

    <para>On Niagara systems such as T2000, hardware SSL crypto acceleration
    runs more slowly than software crypto acceleration. To work around this
    issue take the following actions.</para>

      <para>Add more request handlers to LDAP (for TLS) and LDAPS (for SSL)
      connection handlers.</para>

   installation instructions on allowing OpenDJ to use at least 64K (65536)
   file descriptors, and on tuning the JVM appropriately.</para>
