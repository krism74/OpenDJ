  <title>Who Should Read this Guide</title>

  <para>This guide is written for directory integrators and administrators who
  build, deploy, and maintain OpenDJ directory services for your
  organizations.</para>

  <para>This guide starts by introducing the OpenDJ administrative interfaces
  and tools, and by showing how to manage OpenDJ server processes. It also
  demonstrates how to import and export directory data. This guide continues
  by showing how to configure and monitor the principle features of individual
  OpenDJ servers, and how to configure and monitor replicated server
  topologies for distributed high availability. It then demonstrates how to
  tune, troubleshoot, and move servers.</para>

  <para>You do not need to be an LDAP wizard to learn something from this
  guide, though a background in directory services and maintaining server
  software can help. You do need some background in managing servers and
  services on your operating system of choice. You can nevertheless get
  started with this guide, and then learn more as you go along.</para>
