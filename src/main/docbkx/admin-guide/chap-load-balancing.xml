 <title>Balancing Workload Across Servers</title>

 <para>One main reason for deploying a directory proxy server is to balance
 workload across the directory servers available. Load balancing works
 particularly well for read operations, as each directory server can respond
 to read operations without impact on other directory servers. Load balancing
 can also be used in reverse for write operations, as in a replicated
 environment the results of each write operation must be applied on all
 directory servers to keep their data in sync.</para>
 
 <para>This chapter demonstrates how to configure proxy load balancing of
 client application traffic.</para>
