 <title>Moving Servers</title>
 <indexterm><primary>Moving servers</primary></indexterm>
 
 <para>When you change where OpenDJ is deployed, you must take host names,
 port numbers, and certificates into account. The changes can also affect
 your replication configuration. This chapter shows what to do when moving
 a server.</para>

  <title>Overview</title>
  
  <para>From time to time you might change server hardware, file system layout,
  or host names. At those times you move the services running on the system.
  You can move OpenDJ data between servers and operating systems. Most of the
  configuration is also portable.</para>
 
  <indexterm><primary>Certificates</primary></indexterm>
  <itemizedlist>
   <para>Two aspects of the configuration are not portable.</para>
   <listitem>
    <para>Server certificates contain the host name of the system. Even if you
    did not set up secure communications when you installed the server, the
    server still has a certificate used for secure communications on the
    administrative port.</para>
    <para>To resolve the issue with server certificates, you can change the
    server certificates during the move as described in this chapter.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Replication configuration includes the host name and administrative
    port numbers.</para>
    <para>You can work around the issue with replication configuration by
    disabling replication for the server before the move, and then enabling and
    initializing replication again after the move.</para>

 <section xml:id="before-moving-servers">
  <title>Before You Move</title>
  
  <para>Take a moment to determine whether you find it quicker and easier to
  move your server, or instead to recreate a copy. To recreate a copy, install
  a new server, set up the new server configuration to match the old, and then
  copy only the data from the old server to the new server, initializing
  replication from existing data, or even from LDIF if your database is not
  too large.</para>
  
  <para>After you decide to move a server, start by taking it out of
  service. Taking it out of service means directing client applications
  elsewhere, and then preventing updates from client applications, and finally
  disabling replication, too. Directing client applications elsewhere depends
  on your network configuration and possibly on your client application
  configuration. The other two steps can be completed with the
  <command>dsconfig</command> and <command>dsreplication</command>
  commands.</para>

Replication has been successfully enabled.  Note that for replication to work
 you must initialize the contents of the base DN's that are being replicated
 (use dsreplication initialize to do so).

See /tmp/opends-replication-1476402020764482023.log for a detailed log of this
operation.

Preparing base DN dc=example,dc=com to be initialized externally ..... Done.

Now you can proceed to the initialization of the contents of the base DN's on
 all the replicated servers.  You can use the command import-ldif or the binary
 copy to do so.  You must use the same LDIF file or binary copy on each server.

When the initialization is completed you must use the subcommand
 'post-external-initialization' for replication to work with the new base DN's
 contents.
