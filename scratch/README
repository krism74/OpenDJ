This directory structure provides space for OpenDS developers to store files
related to the project that are not appropriate for the trunk/opends branch,
including prototype code, code diffs, mock-ups, and other files.

Any individual with the Committer role in the OpenDS project may use this
space.  Simply create a subdirectory named with your java.net username and
place all content below that directory.

Content placed below this scratch space will be accessible below.
"http://www.opends.org/source/xref/trunk/scratch/".  For example, the URL
"http://www.opends.org/source/xref/trunk/scratch/README" may be used to
access this file.

Guidelines for using this scratch space are as follows:

- Individuals will be responsible for managing their own content.  Please try
  to keep the amount of space consumed to a minimum, and please try to clean up
  on a regular basis to remove files that are no longer needed.

- Individuals should use common sense when deciding whether something is
  appropriate.  This space should only be used to hold content related to the
  project.  No offensive content will be allowed, nor any content that you do
  not have the legal right to publish or should not be made public.

- Any third-party code or libraries you wish to place here must be approved
  ahead of time, just like anywhere else in the project.

- Individuals should only update files in someone else's scratch space with the
  owner's approval.
