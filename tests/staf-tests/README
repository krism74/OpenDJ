[1] Prepare run

$ ./build tests-configure

=> for the question "Enter java home", the default value is a jre, in some tests we use javac so to avoid 
some errors during the tests enter a path to a jdk

After running this command the following file is created: functional-tests-<hostname>.properties

=> if you want to change the list of tests to be executed, edit this file and update the variable: test.plan.custom
for instance: test.plan.custom=replication,core

[2] Running the tests

$ ./build tests-run

[3] Monitoring the tests

$ ./build staf-gui

or

in your browser open the following file: 
<log_dir>/<hostname>-<timestamp>/reports/results_tmp.xml
